# Catshit Accessory for ExpressionEngine 2.0

### Overview

Lord only knows why the Category Image field gives us no way of uploading, or inserting a fucking image.

I'm so filled with RAGE at this point, because I've spent two hours on the absolute mess that is the EE filemanager.

2 hours figuring out how to make the filemanager appear and populate a farking text field with the filename.

Anyway.

### Installation

Download the accessory and rename the download folder to `catshit`

Insert the `catshit` folder to your `system/third_party` folder and activate the accessory.


### Usage

The function it gives is **ONLY** available when editing categories on the publish page, simply double click the `Image Category` field and up will pop the file manager. et voila.
